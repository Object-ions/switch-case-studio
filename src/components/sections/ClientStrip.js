/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *
 * "Trusted by" marquee — TEXT wordmarks (2026-07, DESIGN_AUDIT P1-6,
 * Moses's pick: option B now, real logos later).
 *
 * The old version marqueed the case-study COVER-TILE images as 96px
 * squares — screenshots posing as logos, and the darkest covers read
 * as empty black squares on the #000 page. Client names as styled text
 * are honest proof and can't vanish.
 *
 * DERIVED from projects.json (2026-08-29) — same law as PRICING_LINKS/
 * PROJECT_LINKS: a component-local copy WILL drift, and this one did
 * (Florida Green shipped 2026-08-26 and never made it here). `featured`
 * AND not `studioProject`: a strip labelled "Trusted by" lists clients,
 * not our own products (Scout, Jelly Belly Wiki) or non-client work
 * (Birth of Venus). Adding a featured client updates the marquee
 * automatically. The loop is
 * count-agnostic (translateX(-50%) over a duplicated track), so length
 * changes need no CSS edit.
 *
 * LOGO-READY: a project may carry `clientLogo` (path to a real wordmark
 * asset) + `clientLogoAlt` in projects.json. When present it renders
 * instead of the text — upgrading to option A is a data edit, not a
 * refactor. Before adding a logo, verify its provenance/permission
 * (CLAUDE.md rule).
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ */
